# Faith Subscriptions Migrate Color

## Purpose

This module does not use the normal migration system, it instead uses the "structure_sync" module to treat some content, such as taxonomy terms, more like configuration instead of content. In this case, "colors" are official church-sanctioned colors that should be managed via taxonomy terms. These terms must be imported before the content which references the colors.

## Directions

TBD
